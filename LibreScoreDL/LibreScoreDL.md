wtf why is it so bloated

a script, js script. 1.8MB. what the actual fuck.

literally, the largest single foss software i saw was tightvnc with 3.4MB in vs2010

i mean just literally, i have no way to imagine how do people actually write this shit and maintain it

and dont your js compilers minify this???

vscode stuck for whole 43.7 seconds for me just pasting in! (formatter did this however)
