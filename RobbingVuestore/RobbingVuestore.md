oh, seems to be a exploiter script used against ahedu.cn

few years ago when i was in grade 8, i found it got severe id bypass vulners but it seems to have a full rewrite and fixed that

and few years later i wondered if they can still make another pile o' shit so checked out thoese role keys in vue stores

i still remember when i was exploring, it got roles hierarchy like student, teacher, admin, principal, municipality-headmaster, provincial-headmaster and state-headmaster superadmin or smth

first this got state level indicates this system is universal across provinces, only UIs differ

second you see superadmin is atop state-headmaster! this fills you with determination for learning CS (not really)
