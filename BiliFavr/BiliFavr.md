Uh, open a vid collection, fill in ids and automates the favorite process (shorcut key 'k')

useful when trying to do massive filterings, like i collecting some uploaders' hundreds or thousands of videos for musics, you cant blame me for being lazy to click favorite icon click checkboxes click confirm though

but literally, i still import musics i collected to lx-music, so probably you can indeed blame me for why not add a PR for bili platform support in lx, and i like to tell you im working on it at least!
